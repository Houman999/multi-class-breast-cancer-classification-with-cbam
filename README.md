<font size="6"> **What is Breast Cancer and Type of that:** </font>

<font size="4">Breast cancer is a complex and progressive disease that develops in the breast tissues, often originating from the milk-producing lobules or the ducts that carry milk to the nipple. The image below provides a comprehensive overview of the stages of breast cancer development and highlights the transition from benign to malignant forms.
This process begins with normal cells lining the duct walls, which may gradually develop abnormalities (atypical hyperplasia) and eventually develop into ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), where the cancer cells are confined within the duct. As the disease progresses, cancer cells break through the duct walls, become invasive, and in severe cases, metastatic cancer develops and spreads to other parts of the body through the blood and lymphatic system.</font>

<font size="6">**Benign breast tumors**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Benign breast tumors are non-cancerous tumors that can develop in breast tissue. The following are distinct histological types of benign breast tumors:</font>
<br>

<font size="4">**Adenose**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Adenosis is characterized by an increase in the number of glandular structures in the breast tissue. It can sometimes mimic cancer but is generally considered benign.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**fibroadenoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors, especially in young women. They are composed of both glandular and stromal (connective) tissue, which are well defined as masses on imaging studies.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**Phylloid tumor**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Phyllode tumors, also known as phyllodes cystosarcomas, are rare fibroepithelial tumors that can be benign or malignant. They usually grow quickly and can be large at the time of diagnosis. Histologically, they show a leaf-like architecture.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**Tubular adenoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Tubular adenomas are rare benign tumors composed primarily of tubular structures. They may be confused with fibroadenomas, but have distinct histological features, including elongated ducts and minimal stromal component.</font>
<br>

<font size="6">**Malignant breast tumors**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Malignant breast tumors are cancerous tumors that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. The following are distinct histological types of malignant breast tumors:</font>
<br>

<font size="4">**ductal carcinoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer that originates from the milk ducts. It can be further classified into invasive and non-invasive forms (ductal carcinoma in situ). Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tends to spread beyond the ducts into surrounding breast tissue.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**Lobular carcinoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Lobular carcinoma arises from the lobules (milk-producing glands) of the breast. Similar to ductal carcinoma, it can be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive lobular carcinoma often appears as a subtle thickening rather than a distinct mass.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**Mucinous carcinoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Mucinous carcinoma is a rare subtype characterized by the presence of mucin-producing cancer cells. This cancer has a better prognosis than other types of invasive breast cancer due to its slower growth rate.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">**Papillary carcinoma**</font>
<br>
<font size="4">Papillary carcinoma is another rare form of breast cancer that usually appears as a well-defined mass with a papillary structure under microscopic examination. It can be invasive or non-invasive and is often associated with better results compared to more invasive types.</font>
